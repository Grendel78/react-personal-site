# Personal Website – Joedy Felts

This is the source code for my personal website, built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It serves as my online portfolio and a showcase of my work, skills, and projects.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** – Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework (optional, if you're using it)
- **Lucide Icons** – Icon set for modern UIs
